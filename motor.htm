<ul>
  <li><h5><font face="Arial"><strong>W</strong>ith two lifter motors and one turning motor, we
    needed something to <br>
    control them. To do this with relays, it would have needed about 14 in total. <br>
    Each speaker goes up at a certain time and comes down in a certain time<br>
    and order. A safety circuit was built in just in case something went wrong<br>
    or if the tweeter missed its mark. In the last, car we once had the pod almost <br>
    go right through the windshield. This design eliminates that problem. Notice<br>
    the double-sided design work and hand placed, &nbsp;Surface Mounted Parts. All<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;of this work was done under a magnifying glass with a steady hand in Henrys<br>
    house. LED's were added to the board so we can follow every step of the<br>
    board's functions for problems. I almost forgot that Henry did 100% of the<br>
    design work on this board. Some of the computer layouts and diagrams are<br>
    pictured below. </font></h5>

    <strong>F</strong>irst the board was designed on a CAD program. Another program then laid <br>
    out the locations of all parts.<br>
    Once this was finalized, Henry printed out a clear film of the board and then<br>
    shot it under light like a picture. <br>
    An impression was then left on the board.<br>
    Next it was put into various chemicals to remove the unwanted copper and<br>
    finally each hole was drilled out by hand for component placement.</font></h5>
