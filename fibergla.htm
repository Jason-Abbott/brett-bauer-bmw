  <li><h5><font face="Arial"><strong>I</strong> have been in some other competition cars, and
    when someone would <br>
    sit in the rear seat the seat back or bottom would sink in sometimes. This<br>
    was due to woofers behind the seat with all support for the cushions removed.<br>
    &nbsp; Since I use this car every day, a good rear seat with the correct support<br>
    was needed. Secondly, why not use the area under the seat to gain more points?.<br>
    So I made it a display area and fully finished.</font></h5>

    <strong>R</strong>ear seat, bottom cover was removed to expose the foam.<br>
    1/8 inch, thick metal was heated and bent into shape. This could support<br>
    hundreds of pounds.<br>
    It was then attached to the seat body and formed into a different shape due <br>
    to the two larger then stock batteries.<br>
    For the under seat and battery cover plate, tin foil was laid down to the needed shape.<br>
    Seven layers of fiberglass were then applied.<br>
    After it was dry, Bondo was used to smooth out this piece.<br>
    An opening was left to highlight the running of speakers cables.<br>
    Easy removal was a must in the design.<br>
    And the finished look. </font></h5>
