  <li><h5><font face="Arial"><strong>A</strong>gain, If you have some space let's highlight it
    and do something special. Henry<br>
    came up with a strong plan for making these parts. Machining new capacitor<br>
    bars and rods out of solid brass and making a wire loom bracket for the fuse<br>
    block. I always get a bunch of points for this.</font></h5>

    <strong>A</strong> solid piece of brass was first marked off for shape.<br>
    This was followed with some machine work and smoothing of the edges.<br>
    A brass rod was then put on the lathe and sized with a end notch.<br>
    Another special shaped positive power connector was then made.<br>
    It then bolted together as one unit as planned.<br>
    Looms for the cables were then added to the fuse block. <br>
    When all was done, it was clear coated for safety reasons. You can touch most<br>
    of the brass and nothing conducts to the touch. This prevented us from having<br>
    to make a Plexiglas cover, which would have ruined the look. </font></h5>
