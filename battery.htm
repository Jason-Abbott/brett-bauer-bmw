    shine for extra points. Due to the large<br>
    power draw of the Milbert amplifiers, two batteries were needed. Instead<br>
    of just using a cable between the batteries, Henry got a brainstorm and <br>
    &nbsp;the work started. The end result was great. What to do about venting the<br>
    battery?????? Another Henry brainstorm. Why not make caps to fit<br>
    over the battery vents and pipe it to the outside. The final touch was to GOLD<br>
    plate all of the battery for a highlighted and different look.</font></h5>

    <strong>Y</strong>ou first start with a solid brass bar and get it true.<br>
    Round the edges and thread the end posts so they grip the battery.<br>
    Cut the expansion slot with a side cutter. <br>
    Aluminum wire, guide brackets were machined to fit cable and battery stubs.<br>
    For the battery vents, square metal was first drilled with vent holes.<br>
    Then turned o the lathe inside and out.<br>
    Screws then had their centers drilled out so gas can flow.<br>
    Shown is the final caps.<br>
    Parts that were gold plated.</font></h5>
