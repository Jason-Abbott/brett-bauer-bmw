<p class="MsoNormal"><b><u>THE PROBLEMS WITH IASCA AND WHY THE END COULD BE NEAR</u></b><br>
<br>
First the problems, then the solutions<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
FIRST, THE IASCA FINALS:<br>
<br>
&nbsp; a. <b><u>FINALS OBSERVATIONS</u></b>- First off, I would
like to give the people at<br>
IASCA who managed the show an A+. Darryl Bell and the others at IASCA did a<br>
stellar job. I did not encounter a single problem. The Dallas Convention<br>
Center had great facilities. I especially liked the newly-formed competitor's<br>
parking area. It was a pleasure. I only had to clean my car once and I kept<br>
cool all weekend. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> b. <b><u>JUDGING</u></b>- In my opinion, the judging was
good.&nbsp; I know other competitors<br>
who talked about the large point spreads between the two sheets.&nbsp; However,
as<br>
long as everyone in my class is judged the same way, it really does not make a<br>
difference and it is OK by me. A large portion of points can be allotted to<br>
personal taste.&nbsp; I wish I did better, but no one was to blame but myself.<br>
Let's not take for granted the honesty of the judges. You never hear of judges<br>
&quot;cheating&quot; at any of the Finals. This in itself is a great
accomplishment.<br>
Many other sports have this problem. <br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; c. <b><u>FINALS PROBLEMS &amp; THINGS TO COME</u></b>- I
must quibble about some issues that<br>
concern our hobby as a whole. First, there was a lot less companies with<br>
booths and the size of the group as a whole was small compared to previous<br>
Finals.&nbsp; A lot less floor traffic was very evident this year.&nbsp; A LOT
LESS.&nbsp; At<br>
the IASCA Finals in Greenville, South Carolina, people were lining up at the<br>
doors, banging on the glass demanding entry into this 12 Volt festival. In<br>
contrast, Dallas had few spectators lining up, but no where near the numbers<br>
as Greenville.&nbsp; There was no big rush when the doors opened.&nbsp; Less
booth<br>
activity means less revenue to fuel our industry and next year count on even<br>
less booths.&nbsp; I have talked to some manufacturers and they are not
returning<br>
because of very low traffic in the convention hall.&nbsp; Once this talk
starts,<br>
future IASCA Finals are doomed.&nbsp; Whoever was responsible for local media<br>
coverage missed the boat- this will affect the support of all IASCA<br>
competitors and future shows.&nbsp; A company may spend $30,000 for a booth,<br>
airfare, hotels and meals.&nbsp; They want returns for that money.&nbsp; In
Dallas they<br>
got none. In contrast USAC&#146;s finals had the best traffic in there history. Many<br>
said more traffic
then at Dallas. USAC&#146;s people had everything in the public<br>
relations department
right. Face the fact, that IASCA must in the future be tied <br>
to a larger show to
draw people<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>because they don&#146;t know how
to bring the crowds in. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> d. <b><u>IASCA BECOMING INSIGNIFICANT TO THE CAR AUDIO
INDUSTRY</u></b>-<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The guy from Kimber Cable was at Finals for the first
time.&nbsp; They sell<br>
high end home cables. His job was to assess the car audio business and see if<br>
there a place for Kimber Cable here.&nbsp; A group of us asked him what his<br>
assessment of the whole thing was: He expected more traffic and booths. The<br>
shocker that came out of his mouth was &quot;I heard from a lot of people that<br>
IASCA lost focus and direction.&quot;&nbsp; It is becoming secondary and
support is<br>
waning.&nbsp; WOW- this from a first-time visitor.&nbsp; His original thought
was being<br>
aligned with IASCA would be the right thing to do, but after this show IASCA<br>
alignment remained unimportant.&nbsp; He felt it would be insignificant for his<br>
company to sell products to mobile audio enthusiasts. <br>
&nbsp; </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> e. <b><u>LESS LOCAL EVENTS AND LESS MIND BLOWING INSTALLS</u></b>-<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were also less mind blowing cars at the show than in
year's past.<br>
Don't get me wrong, there were some great cars at this year's Finals, but I<br>
think the &quot;outrageous&quot; factor was gone. Anyone with a history of
attending<br>
this event knows that in year's past, the caliber of &quot;WOW BLOW ME
AWAY&quot; cars<br>
was much better. This show may be a harbinger of a waning interest in building<br>
real competition cars.&nbsp; Less local shows make people question spending so
much<br>
on a car.&nbsp; Because of a lack of IASCA local events, some competitors were
even<br>
allowed to attend without the requisite 35 IASCA Trophy points needed for<br>
entry into the Finals. The lanes actually should have had even less<br>
competitors. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> f. <b><u>WHERE DID THE WORLD PRESS GO</u></b>? <br>
This year, there were less overseas journalists in attendance. This was very<br>
obvious to me. The IASCA Finals are just not holding the importance it did in<br>
previous years.&nbsp; Maybe they know something that IASCA doesn't.&nbsp; I
always had<br>
press from all over the globe taking photos of cars and talking. This year<br>
they never showed up. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> g. <b><u>ALMA AND DB CONTEST</u></b><br>
Then there was the newly-formed IDBL that replaced dB Drag Racing.&nbsp; My
biggest<br>
disappointment is that Alma did not compete- that hurt everyone.&nbsp; Without
Alma<br>
Gates competing the IDBL competition lacked excitement. If you were lucky<br>
enough to attend last year's Finals in Greenville, there was electricity<br>
around the dB Drag Racing. Who came up with this 80 or 100 Hz filter idea a<br>
few weeks before finals??&nbsp; No one won here.&nbsp; dB Dragsters are<br>
there to post high numbers; not lower ones!&nbsp; Alma would only hit about
165dB<br>
with the filters- a big let down from 172 dB. It looks bad in print.&nbsp; In<br>
addition, without Wayne Harris things just didn't click like in the past. Yes<br>
Mark Fukuda did a great job, but again there was <b><u>NO ELECTRICITY</u></b>
in the air or<br>
any big SPL rivalries.&nbsp; I am sure there are reasons on both sides for his<br>
absence, but everyone missed out because of it.&nbsp; The big SPL boys stayed
away.<br>
Everyone lost. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> h. <b><u>LITTLE BUSINESS BEING DONE AT FINALS</u></b>-<br>
The last time I was in Dallas Convention Center for a Finals, I noticed tons<br>
of people and manufacturers doing business by the eating area around the main<br>
entrance. But not this year. This area was always barren. Another indication<br>
of what is to come. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> I. <b><u>TWEAK AND TUNE AND LESS JUDGING TRAFFIC</u></b>.<br>
Although it was nice to move the tweak-and-tune area out of the basement, this<br>
area was very quiet this year. It was really lacking excitement.&nbsp; In past<br>
years it was a melting pot of energy. <br>
Finally, there was a lot less traffic looking at our cars while in the judging<br>
area. Last year the judging area was packed with lots of people. This year the<br>
isles were relatively empty except for competitors and co-pilots. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> j. <b><u>NOTICE THAT THE CAR AUDIO MAGAZINES ARE GETTING
THINNER</u></b>?<br>
Where were the big booths for the magazines? Is it that there circulation is<br>
growing so fast they don't need to exhibit? I think not!&nbsp; All the
magazines<br>
had smaller booths than in years past. IASCA has created no real excitement or<br>
publicity outside of our hobby.&nbsp; They did not create any heroes or big<br>
competition. Check out this months issue of Car Audio and Auto Sound
Security.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A lot thinner which proves,
that without excitement, no new readers. Simple. I said this last year but no
one listened. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> k. <b><u>INTERNET AND THE PROBLEMS WITH THE BORING AND STALE IASCA
WEBSITE</u></b><br>
The Internet was always the haven to talk about IASCA.&nbsp; Before Finals in
the<br>
past, my mailbox was full with letters regarding the Finals and many other<br>
competitors are buzzing in anticipation. It never happened this year. There<br>
was not a single e-mail asking me for Finals results. IASCA is just not<br>
sparking the interest it has in the past. We are talking to a smaller<br>
audience. My web site gets more traffic than IASCA's. My small web site, as an<br>
individual! This is embarrassing!!!!!!!!! Every night I get an average of 2200<br>
hits for the entire site. If you like to read boring statistics, I have the 42<br>
page &quot;Webstat&quot; report if you need more proof.&nbsp; I also know what
search engines<br>
and what keywords people are using to find car audio stuff.&nbsp; IASCA keyword
is<br>
getting fewer and fewer calls.&nbsp; I have the proof if you need it.&nbsp; On
the<br>
rec.audio.car newsgroup, there were only a few of the same people talking<br>
about the IASCA Finals. There were fewer people involved or interested in the<br>
IASCA Finals as in years past. On the World Wide Web only one site had all the<br>
Final's results- CarSound Magazine. They got the scores posted within a day or<br>
so.&nbsp; Thirteen days AFTER THE FINALS IASCA HAS YET TO POST SCORES!!!!!!!!!.<br>
They are having a upload problem. Hey, everyone gets a computer glitch once in<br>
awhile, but you would think that after this much time the results would be<br>
posted. If there were proper management, this problem would be rectified much<br>
sooner.&nbsp; Plus, the IASCA site does not hold any real interest to someone
who<br>
casually stumbles upon it. Instead of boring and outdated statistics, a better<br>
idea would be a Real Video movie on the site from the President, an Install<br>
Judge, and a Sound Quality judge explaining the judging process. People like<br>
to see pictures, but there are no pictures of cars on the site. The USAC site<br>
has pictures. Maybe movies of how our events are run. Or movies of the Finals.<br>
But day to day, nothing is done, nothing is improved. I have Streaming Real<br>
Video on my page and no staff to maintain it. Over 535 pictures, 14 audio <br>
streams, 4 video streams and 37 pages of text, and it is just me,to maintain<br>
the site. Remember I have no computer education.Show IASCA Finals so <br>
an interested party could take a simple
movie tour of<br>
the judging process and come out really learning something about IASCA. <br>
IASCA is really showing signs of stagnation on the World Wide Web. When I type<br>
in the word &quot;IASCA&quot; in Yahoo or most other search engines, the IASCA
site does<br>
not come up. My site comes up, but the IASCA one does not. There is something<br>
wrong here...Updates must be frequent. The Internet is the future and it is<br>
just passing the IASCA site by with its plethora of stale material. Check out<br>
the NHRA site and you see up-to-the-minute news. I visited the site on October<br>
17, at 8 a.m. Pacific time and it had already been updated.&nbsp; But of
course,<br>
this page has paying sponsors.. Are there any car audio manufacturers
interested<br>
anymore in
sponsoring a page? <br>
I think a great way to spark interest in the IASCA site would be to give perks<br>
for IASCA members. Members-only perks can increase membership and interest,<br>
with very little cost. Also, I would think IASCA would like to give some<br>
recognition to its supporting manufacturers. But at this point, I don't think<br>
some of these manufacturers care anymore...&nbsp; The IASCA website could also<br>
feature magazine links to help further educate a novice enthusiast. But again,<br>
nothing was ever done like this so far...<br>
Speaking of magazines, lets face it- they have to give positive press to IASCA<br>
because of their position. So don't look for a letter like this to ever be<br>
printed in one. But in reality not much good news came out of Finals. <br>
I even noticed less faces of people that normally compete. It is normal for<br>
people to grow out of a hobby like this, but too many of last year's faces<br>
were absent. I always get updates from USAC via e-mail telling me about new<br>
shows, policies, and other interesting ideas. Two words- Good Management.<br>
<br>
L. <b><u>LISTEN UP IASCA:<br>
</u></b>Now dB Drag and USAC have joined. YOUR LOSS.&nbsp; Manufacturers are
dividing their<br>
money for shows and Wayne's show brings in people.&nbsp; Look for less<br>
manufacturers to support you...Beware IASCA, unless is something is not done,<br>
you have no future!&nbsp; The USAC show was a success and I predict that money
will flow to them next year and not you. USAC was a small &#147;Hillbilly&#148;
reputation organization in the past , but this has changed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>IASCA has a rich history of change and it is
time for a<br>
big change! I will speak the real truth. I'm not on anyone's payroll in the<br>
car audio industry which allows me to speak my mind.&nbsp; About the only good
show<br>
left is the Spring Break Nationals; a great majority of shows throughout the<br>
US have less attendance.&nbsp; IASCA has no heroes or people to cheer for
anymore.<br>
In year's past, Finals winners were celebrities. Now the media has so few<br>
people to turn to anymore.<br>
IASCA, listen up! Your financial support will be waning. How does a company's<br>
marketing person support IASCA budget money with no return-on-investment?&nbsp;
And<br>
the magazines should worry too!&nbsp; Do they benefit from less competitors?&nbsp;
NO!<br>
All of us in car audio should worry about their circulation.&nbsp; Notice the<br>
thinner issues? <br>
<br>
M. <b><u>USAC IS ROLLING RIGHT PAST IASCA AND THE IASCA MANAGEMENT COULD CARE
LESS.<br>
</u></b>If I were to do a direct comparison of USAC to IASCA for the past few
years,<br>
the results would be startling.&nbsp; For example: USAC has three board members
and<br>
more shows than IASCA?????????????&nbsp; IASCA has 20 board members and maybe
six<br>
people in the office and less shows??????????<br>
It used to be USAC was a second rate nothing organization. They were having a<br>
few shows but they were small potatoes compared to IASCA shows. Then USAC,<br>
slowly but surely, started making more shows. But the IASCA attitude was
&quot;They<br>
will never have as many shows as us, we are IASCA.&quot;<br>
Then, USAC had more shows on the schedule than IASCA, but the IASCA attitude<br>
was &quot;Their shows are not as good as ours.&quot;<br>
Now the IASCA attitude is &quot;We are worldwide and USAC is only in the United<br>
States.&quot;&nbsp; Wait and see... <br>
Bottom Line: The IASCA management is not reacting to market changes. No<br>
direction. No plan, No goals. You are lost. <br>
<br>
N. <b><u>I AM BITTER AS FUCKING HELL AND IASCA MANAGEMENT COULD CARE LESS</u></b>
<br>
You, by you inactivity and vision are letting a hobby, that many of us love,<br>
just slip away.&nbsp;You and you alone ruined a love for me, competing and
music.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If I had <br>
vision like yours in
my company, I would be homeless by now. This year alone my company<br>
 sales are up
56%<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>from 1997, so I know of what I
speak.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><br>
Remember the time I was contacted by CNBC to do a segment on car audio with<br>
the BMW?&nbsp; I was pumped and excited. The first worldwide coverage of car
audio.<br>
I called IASCA and faxed them of the time. Just think of it, we made it to<br>
prime time in the US, Asia, Europe and many other countries.&nbsp; I drove to
the<br>
NBC Burbank (739 mile round trip) at The Jay Leno Studio. I again called IASCA<br>
that morning to remind them of this. I posted it on the newsgroup. Everyone<br>
knew. The interview went great: I wore my IASCA shirt, explained competition,<br>
and gave some great positive publicity.&nbsp; I even had the IASCA telephone
number<br>
ready on the teleprompter for interested parties, but they ran out of time.<br>
When it was over, my cell phone was just ringing with everyone that saw it.<br>
When I got home my e-mail had 81 car audio people saying it was great.&nbsp; My<br>
answering machine was filled with good messages.&nbsp; 2812 hits in about an
hour's<br>
time to my site.&nbsp; Only one problem- nothing from IASCA.&nbsp; The
organization that<br>
I pushed as a member by getting worldwide coverage for the car audio
cause.&nbsp; I<br>
called IASCA the next day to see what they thought.&nbsp; Never saw it.&nbsp;
Not one<br>
person saw it.&nbsp; Two faxes and two phone calls and no one in IASCA tuned
in.<br>
They said send them a tape.&nbsp; What an insult.&nbsp; That shows no concern
for any<br>
member or widening media coverage.&nbsp; I was devastated but I kept it to<br>
myself... <br>
But it happened again: I got four pages in Time magazine.&nbsp; This is a once
in a<br>
lifetime thing.&nbsp; It was the first car audio system in history to ever be<br>
featured in this publication.&nbsp; 4,250,000 copies. More then all of the car<br>
audio magazines combined for over a year.&nbsp; I was reaching all new
potential<br>
people to get into our sport.&nbsp; I literally carried the Time reporter to
the<br>
IASCA office so they could get coverage. The guy said repeatedly that the<br>
story was on me and not IASCA, but I pressed on. The day it hit the stands<br>
tons of the car audio people did the same as before- &quot;Great article!&nbsp;
All<br>
positive!&quot;&nbsp; But again, nothing from IASCA, even after faxes and calls
to let<br>
them know of this major coverage.&nbsp; They never got an issue until a week
later.<br>
<br>
Then I did another TV interview on 13 stations throughout the Southwest on the<br>
top-rated morning show.&nbsp; It was on in their own town and no one at IASCA<br>
watched. <br>
<br>
I don't expect anyone to kiss my backside, but if a member gets media coverage<br>
promote the organization, IASCA should at least read about it or watch
it.&nbsp; It<br>
shows the lack of interest, concern, and any measure of professionalism.&nbsp;
If<br>
they don't care about getting the word out about IASCA, who does?<br>
<br>
O. <b><u>WHAT DO THE SIX PEOPLE WHO RUN IASCA DO DURING THE OFF-SEASON?<br>
</u></b>In my letter last year I suggested that they visit local stores and get
the<br>
interest level up.&nbsp; Nothing happened here. They think new shows in Arizona
and<br>
California will come from heaven.&nbsp; THINK AGAIN!&nbsp; Most of the shows in
the<br>
California and Arizona market show a clear downward trend in attendance. Once<br>
a store has this experience, don't count on a 1999 show. <br>
Last year, we had two to three shows in the fifth largest city in the US.<br>
Twelve months of warm weather in a state that loves cars- but virtually no<br>
soundoffs.&nbsp; If you worked in my marketing department, you would be fired<br>
immediately for incompetence. Your people should be visiting shops in the<br>
surrounding states and setting the stage for 1999 competitions and forging<br>
relationships with local dealers.</p>

<h4>Ask IASCA</h4>

<p class="MsoNormal">How many stores have been visited to talk up competition?</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">You have about 18 major media markets. How many TV stations
have been called?</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">How is the results for each market. Call back, not interested,
will do story?????</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">How many new shows that are tied with other car shows are in
the works?<br>
<br>
Remember the idea of giving tours of car audio factories during a big soundoff<br>
in Phoenix since we live here??? <br>
Nothing done<br>
<br>
How about linking together IASCA soundoffs with any of the other car shows in<br>
Arizona for 1998??? <br>
Nothing done.<br>
<br>
P. <b><u>WHERE DID THE $22,000 GO IASCA???????</u></b><br>
People ask me why I didn't buy a new car and spend $22,000 on the new install:<br>
I was going to buy a new car and had budgeted $22,000 for the building of a<br>
new competition car. (Audio A6)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After
going to a Nogalis soundoff with 14 cars, a San<br>
Diego soundoff (768 miles round trip) with 27, and an El Paso show (1090 mile<br>
round trip) with 3 people in my class, I had to seriously question this and<br>
what future IASCA had.&nbsp; My friend went to one of the shows near Magic
Mountain<br>
in California and he laughed at the small turnout of 19 cars. This is in a big
state like California!!!!!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Somone is not doing a job in the publicity department. Then
the disasterous turnout at finals!!!! <br>
So with the car audio competition scene lost, I would rather keep my disposable
income.<br>
I just did about $7000 worth of upgrades to my current car and with my outlook<br>
of the Finals, I should have not spent even that. I am sure other people are<br>
adopting this way of thinking. I am all for great sound in my car even without<br>
IASCA, but the install does not have to look as good as it does if it<br>
is just for my listening pleasure... Again, the management of IASCA is not<br>
reacting to the competitors or changing market conditions. USAC had over 400<br>
shows. <br>
<br>
Q. <b><u>MY REALIZATION THAT MIKE JAFFE WAS INCOMPETENT TO LEAD IASCA FURTHER
MAY BE TRUE</u></b><br>
Look at other organizations, such as NHRA- man, they have it together. Great<br>
site, magazine coverage, involvement, growing membership, even TV coverage...<br>
I know Mike J. would say &quot;It is only 5 seconds down the track...What the
hell<br>
are you going to do for the rest of the time? It is boring listening to a guy<br>
talking about pistons...&quot; We need leadership direction and it is missing
here.<br>
<br>
When I had lunch with Mike at Chili's, instead of trying to work out some<br>
problems, it turned into a yelling and cursing match in a public place.&nbsp; I
did<br>
not appreciate getting yelled and cursed at by Mike at a public restaurant<br>
over my old 11 page plan. I think he took it as questioning his job ability<br>
and trying to set direction. That report was only to show a possible direction<br>
for IASCA. Every single response on the internet (over 200) , phone calls<br>
(about 30) and letters about were positive of its direction. But not with<br>
Mike.<br>
I suggested IASCA being televised. &quot;Watching a soundoff on TV is like
watching<br>
grass grow&quot; said Mike. Because of not reacting to my 11 page plan, the
results<br>
one year later are very obvious. Recently, I watched a Mopar show with 30 cars<br>
for 30 minutes. Nothing special, but they made 30 minutes out of it. MTV makes<br>
a close-up of a person standing still look like something<br>
amazing. The IASCA theory on television would be have an announcer question<br>
the competitor- &quot;What improvements did you make this year?&quot; while the<br>
competitor stated his win record. &quot;This would bore anyone to death,&quot;
Jaffe<br>
suggested. Tell that to Jeff &quot;Showtime&quot; Gasier or Mike Mineo. <b><u>NO
VISION</u></b>.<br>
<br>
R<b><u>. THE FUTURE, IF ANY, OF IASCA COMPETITION</u></b>: <br>
I feel in the near future Circuit City will break off and do more non-<br>
sanctioned IASCA events. Circuit City was IASCA's best hope, but this is<br>
fading. What do they need IASCA for? I have seen how well some of their shows<br>
are managed. At this particular moment, I don't see much light at the end of<br>
the tunnel. Keep in mind the magazines lose, the dealers lose, and<br>
manufactures lose because of IASCA not managing the organization properly. You<br>
have to question the whole thing- If the point man can't look to these ideas,<br>
our organization will have no depth or media coverage. Therefore it will be<br>
doomed. USAC will pull ahead of IASCA in 99, and more money will be funneled to
them. <br>
<br>
S. <b><u>IS THERE A SOLUTION IN SIGHT OR IS IT TOO LATE?<br>
</u></b>In the past few weeks I am getting word from manufacturers and a lot of<br>
competitors who lost interest. USAC is quickly gaining share and I feel they<br>
will be the main competition organization. I never would have said this in the<br>
past but things are changing. They are on top of things: they are progressive<br>
and getting lots of shows booked. The money will follow them because they are<br>
growing so fast.&nbsp; Money that should be headed in IASCA's direction will<br>
decrease because of lack of interest and Finals attendance. Our first IASCA<br>
show of the season in Arizona was just held 2 weeks ago. A total of 6 cars
competed. This<br>
is not a market.&nbsp; Even a blind person would know that work needs to be
done in<br>
the off-season in preparation for 1999. In IASCA&#146;s home market let alone. <br>
<br>
Originally, I was thinking of an idea that had USAC merging with IASCA so<br>
there would be one group.&nbsp; But, my idea has changed. My original idea was
to<br>
merge IASCA and USAC and rename it The EXTREME Car Audio Competition<br>
Association. The word &quot;IASCA&quot; does not catch<br>
the spirit of Generation X.&nbsp; Ralph Randall of USAC would have control in
the<br>
areas he is strongest in now, but under the new name and rules. This would<br>
keep him in the game as part of a larger organization. <br>
BUT, now Ralph doesn't have to merge with anyone. I wrote about two pages of<br>
how this would be setup, but this is unimportant now.<br>
USAC doesn't need IASCA.&nbsp; IASCA is already heading downhill. USAC just has
to<br>
wait and can come in for the kill. Manufactures cannot keep splitting money<br>
between IASCA, USAC, and dB Drag events.<br>
<br>
I know that you are curious, so here is my idea on one big mega soundoff<br>
organization- The EXTREME Car Audio Competition Association.&nbsp; Here was a
great<br>
idea if IASCA and USAC joined and got the act together:<br>
<b><u>&#148; GOT CAR STEREO&#148;</u></b><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&#147;Got Milk&#148;
<br>
Each manufacturer that is a member would be required to give a percentage of<br>
sales (obviously a small one) contribution every year towards the<br>
organization. Then, a membership sticker would be allowed to be placed on that<br>
company's equipment to show support. This pays for the office people and most<br>
important, a full time public relations person. That PR person would be<br>
responsible to get our shows covered in print and television. Car audio needs<br>
to be in front of people- visible to everyone. With manufacturers contributing<br>
money they get the advertising advantage of a strong car audio competition<br>
network, but with the cost spread over many companies. Run it just like
&quot;Got<br>
Milk,&quot; the Beef Council, or &quot;Pork, the Other White Meat&quot;
campaigns. These<br>
industries pooled their money and got results. Contributing members would be<br>
recognized by dealers. If a company is not in, a dealer may ask &quot;Why are
you<br>
not pulling your weight? Since the public relations push, my own business has<br>
increased, so I don't know if I can carry your product if you don't support<br>
the industry.&quot; Circuit City would surely ask this question<br>
of the lines it carries. Circuit City and Best Buy would have a big influence<br>
here- &quot;If you don't support the organization, I can't carry that product and<br>
let you freeload off of other companies contributions to public
awareness.&quot;<br>
With more contributions, non-industry advertising and support from major<br>
companies would come. A big company like Coke has to look at IASCA and say
&quot;We<br>
don't want to waste our time with a small organization like this.&quot;&nbsp;
But, how<br>
about the EXTREME car audio league sponsored by Coke and Circuit City?&nbsp; We<br>
would all win. <br>
<br>
I know that this is quite lengthy, but all I am trying to do is help out the<br>
competition scene from dying a slow death. IASCA has some talented people on<br>
the board, but they need to seriously set some goals. I almost forgot to<br>
mention a person that I admire for putting his money where his mouth is- Lloyd<br>
Ivey from MTX. He has many of the right ideas, but you can't expect him to<br>
carry the entire load for car audio industry. <br>
<br>
Please forward responses to IASCA or me and maybe something good can come out<br>
of all of this.<br>
