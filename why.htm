</big></strong></u><font face="Arial">Let it be known that Robert Zeff is one of the great
high end audiophile <br>
designers of the car audio industry. He is the head amplifier designer at Zapco.<br>
Open most amplifiers and you will see quality components. Open the Zapco<br>
and you will see all that plus surface <br>
mount components. This is expensive and very refined building. Just this <br>
one point separates Zapco from the rest. Some of you&nbsp; are familiar with the <br>
Slew or rise time capability of an amplifier. This in car terms is 0-60. <br>
How many volts can an amplifier put out fast. The average slew rate for <br>
most amplifiers is about 20-30 volts per microsecond. The higher the number <br>
the better. You may notice that almost NONE of the major car amplifier <br>
companies publish this figure. Zapco's figure for the Z600 is 73 volts. Many <br>
high end home units have trouble matching this figure. This figures <br>
contributes to snappy sound. When it come to the sound, Robert uses the</font></h5>

amplifiers<br>
as his reference. He is a real <br>
audiophile, designing real audiophile products for the car. About 3 years <br>
ago I hauled my old Zapco Z300 to a friend of mine's house that has a pair <br>
of Martin Logan Electrostatic speakers and Krell amplifiers. Toting a <br>
battery and the amp, we substituted the Zapco for the Krell. All of us had <br>
a tough time telling which was which. The Krell was $ 7200. The moral of <br>
the story, Zapco sounds good, built to advanced standards and their power <br>
ratings are very underrated. My last amp was rated at 150 watts per <br>
channel. We got it measured, and 254 watts per channel as the true figure. <br>
A great value.</font></h5>
