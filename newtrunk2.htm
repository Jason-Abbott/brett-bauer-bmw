  <li><h5><font face="Arial"><strong>A</strong>gain I was tired of all the trunks done in
    stretch gray carpet, so I said <br>
    &quot;Why not an exotic wood with a strong grain?&quot;&nbsp; I picked Zebra Wood from <br>
    South Africa. This wood once cut is soaked in elephant manure for three <br>
    months to darken up the grain. (When you sand this wood, it smells very<br>
    bad) Both amplifiers are mounted on German chromed Steel Spikes. This <br>
    gives me a different and distinct look compared to any other car. All <br>
    amps, players and ES system are suspended from the rear deck by<br>
    rods. In person, this look is strong.</font><br>

    <strong>Trunk lid get covered with Dynamat and then with forming board.<br>
    BMW factory carpet is then applied and a rubber edge is put on. <br>
    </strong>A A plywood form was made before cutting the final Zebra Wood. This wood<br>
    is too expensive to waste.<br>
    Once cut, all edges were sanded down.<br>
    I used 600, grain sandpaper to finish the surface before clear coating. <br>
    Cable and spike holes were drilled on a press.<br>
    Grommets were drilled out for all cables.<br>
    Gold parts that were plated are pictured.</font></h5>
