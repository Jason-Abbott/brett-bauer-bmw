<h5><font face="Arial">The new B &amp; W Nautilus system uses a newly designed 15&quot;
hollow magnet <br>
woofer. To keep the sound as close as the original designer wanted, I kept <br>
the 15 inch. A tough fit but after some listening, well worth it.&nbsp; Anyway when <br>
is the last time you saw a regular sedan with 2 15&quot; subs in that location? <br>
Size matters!!!!!!!!!</font></h5>

    All wires in passenger area get tied down.<br>
    The front plate gets shaped and put into place with sub and side panel. <br>
    The speaker ports into the fender. <br>
    Halogen lights are then installed for color accenting during presentations, and
    fiberglassing begins.<br>
    Deflex panels were glued into place. Having Deflex in the sub enclosure is<br>
    VERY important to the end sound quality. VERY highly recommended. <br>
    Carpet was glued down for the front grill area and trimmed. <br>
    Catch the size of that magnet.<br>
