    advice and recommendations from <br>
    people around the world.&nbsp; Some for advice and some talking about the <br>
    page and others about the different shows. Maybe it is time to share the thoughts with <br>
    others instead of writing the same type of letters to all the e-mail persons. <br>
    I will write about Mapleshade Recording Company first. Keep in mind that none of the
    mentioned manufactures pay me for this writing so I can speak the truth as I see it.<br>

    <strong>A</strong>bout 3 years ago someone said to listen to this companies recording
    because <br>
    they were different from anyone else. After just the first cut I felt God was <br>
    now in the recording business. How could a human get music on a disc like this. <br>
    (More about the details later) As time moved on I submitted some of his cuts to <br>
    be on the new IASCA disc and luckily they were accepted. Even Richard Clark <br>
    jumped on the band wagon. Check out the Mapleshade cuts on track 11,14,15, of <br>
    the new IASCA disc. <br>

    Ever try to get full performance out of your Ferrari on 70 octane gas??????. <br>
    Just like a car or home audio system, you need to feed it the right stuff. You may <br>
    already have a great system but never heard what&nbsp; natural sound it s capable <br>
    of. <br>
    Keep in mind Mapleshade is a very small company. Most of the recordings are done <br>
    in Pierre's living room. He built his recording machine from the ground up. An <br>
    old tape deck modified to the hilt. When recording it runs on batteries to keep <br>
    any noise out of the system. No microphone cable is longer then 4 feet, unlike <br>
    studio cables of at least 100 feet. When the recording starts he is in the <br>
    center of the band crouched around his tape deck in headphones while magical <br>
    music is all around him. This is not the way big studios do it. <br>
    Another VERY important fact is how he treat the artists to get the &quot;<strong><u>ESSENCE</u></strong>&quot;
    of <br>
    there sound. Most every studio puts the artist in the soundproof and says on Q, <br>
    play. Well we all know sometime this makes you loose the real feeling of music. <br>
    Mapleshade does it differently. Most of the artists are invited to stay at <br>
    Mapleshades house for some practicing and when THEY are ready to go, Pierre is <br>
    there. Case in point is a new drum solo CD he just put out. The artist was there <br>
    for a few days composing and playing. On the 3rd day at 2:30 am Pierre gets <br>
    nudged out of bed and all the artist said is &quot;I'M READY&quot;. Could you imagine that
    <br>
    at Sheffield or RCA!&nbsp; They went into the living room and the artist said don't <br>
    turn the lights on. He played the entire CD in 1 take entirely. Pierre working <br>
    only with the lights emitted by his tape deck meter. When it was over and they <br>
    turned the lights on the artist was engulfed in a total sweat with a job well <br>
    done. The results were stunning. You could hear the artist had left this earth <br>
    and gone somewhere else to play, heavy breathing and all. <br>
    His Support Towards Car Audio And IASCA.<br>
    When I first called Pierre and said that I would like to submit his CD's for the <br>
    new IASCA disc his reaction was swift. What is an IASCA or car audio. After explaining the
    <br>
    details he said no problem, but big stereos in cars????? Richard Clark then got <br>
    in touch with him over details. We were all happy when the word came about being <br>
    on the disc. We then discussed about maybe displaying at the IASCA Finals in <br>
    Greenville and he asked what I thought. He ended up sharing the booth with <br>
    Dynaudio. To show you what a real artist is, is the next story. <br>
    He and an assistant packs up the Old Chrysler K car station wagon <strong>( The
    Mapleshabemobile)</strong> with discs and <br>
    heads for Greenville at about 55mph max. No big studio limo here. When he pulled <br>
    into the hotel the back end of the car was on the ground but with a great <br>
    attitude and always willing to try something new, unlike some studios. To his <br>
    surprise within 4 hours he sold 300 CD's and still had never heard a good car <br>
    system. Pierre was just kind of overwhelmed by this car audio stuff which was <br>
    strange to him , a home audiophile. Even with all of the overly loud booming at <br>
    the finals he never complained. That is an accomplishment in itself. When the <br>
    show&nbsp; ended he became part of the fabric of car audio. Persons listened to <br>
    the disc in their car and kept purchasing more and more.&nbsp; Many thought that <br>
    Sheffield was the only brand, but this elevated them to a new level. I <br>
    personally gave free discs out to cars on the floor if they would demo there <br>
    cars using Mapleshade. Most said who is Mapleshade. By the end of the show those <br>
    car owners had bought many different CD's from Pierre.<br>
    Where do you get the recording artist selling at the booth, driving to shows, <br>
    answering and taking phone orders, writing the jackets, doing the recording and <br>
    also there when it is converted for CD. This is an artist that deserves our <br>
    support and in turn his CD's will enlighten your system and senses. <br>
    At the show he did a car audio show special if you bought 3 CD' you get the 4th <br>
    free. Not bad since his CD's are only about 14 dollars. Hard to buy junk or any <br>
    audiophile CD for that kind of money. I think he will still do the same deal for <br>
    you if you mention that you are one of the car audio persons. <br>
    So in closing, your car and even home system can sound better without&nbsp; turning a <br>
    screwdriver. Natural sound and good music to boot and a cheap price from &quot;An <br>
    Artist&quot;. I fully recommend that you try 1 or two CD. The top ones that I would <br>
    say to get is The Salsa CD, Bad Influence, MO Jo and Dink Small. You can't go <br>
    wrong. I have Chesky. Sheffield, Telarc along with many small audiophile labels <br>
    and Mapleshade tops them by a longshot. I want to remind you again I get no pay <br>
    from Mapleshade but when you see a gem you should share it with you car audio <br>
    friends.<br>
    Mapleshade Telephone # USA 301-627-9774&nbsp; or 1-888-CDMAPLE Ask for Eldon or maybe even
    Pierre will <br>
    take your order. When can you order a CD and talk to the Engineer at the same <br>
    time????? They even take&nbsp; Visa.&nbsp; Are they advanced or what?<br>
