<h5><font face="Arial"><strong>T</strong>o be a top-scoring car you need to be different
with your ideas. This is the <br>
first IASCA car to compete with fenders that fold open. They are totally<br>
waterproof and just before most shows.&nbsp; I just dust the inside down for a clean<br>
look. This idea has taken many judges by surprise. Changing a woofer is also <br>
made easier. My record for opening up the fender from scratch is 37 seconds. <br>
<strong>D</strong>ue to the closeness of the sub to the back of the fender, a lot of
reflected<br>
bass was hitting&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the sub and producing a slightly boomy sound. To fix
this,<br>
four&nbsp; soft <u><strong>DEFLEX</strong></u> panels were glued to the inside of the
fender. Any sound or<br>
energy that hits these pads dies right there. After putting them in,<br>
there was a noticeable improvement in the sub response and sound.</font></h5>

    <strong>A</strong>n adjustable stainless-steel cable holder was made and drilled into the
    car body.<br>
    This allows me to set how much I want the fender to open for display. <br>
    Having the fender stay in this position allows me to keep&nbsp; the presentation moving<br>
    without having to worry about where to put the fender.<br>
    Glue was applied&nbsp; and the DEFLEX pads to hold them firmly in place. <br>
    Two panels were then applied per fender. </font></h5>
