<ul>
  <li><h5 align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong>T</strong>he idea was to get a very strong
    front stage of which the subs were considered <br>
    &nbsp;part of.&nbsp; So the placement of the subs ahead of the listener was the natural
    choice.<br>
    It is sometimes hard to locate bass, but when&nbsp; the subs are right in front of you,<br>
    their&nbsp; location is easily found.&nbsp; Many people have listened and always comment<br>
    on the very accurate and strong bass line. Keep in mind that since the subs are<br>
    up front, the sound hits less surfaces and bounces and changes directions fewer<br>
    times before hitting the listener. These subs have a resonant frequency of 17 Hz<br>
    &nbsp;running full free air.&nbsp; The subs will port through this cutout. </font></h5>

    <strong>F</strong>irst the fender was removed and the original brackets that held them in
    place,<br>
    were modified for easy removal of outer fender at judging time. <br>
    The car body&nbsp; was opened up and trimmed to the same shape as the sub ring opening.<br>
    Then the Bridgeport Milling machine&nbsp; did all cuts&nbsp; within 5/1000 of an inch
    tolerance. <br>
    Due to the hardness and thickness of the steel, three passes were made, each one deeper. <br>
    <strong>O</strong>nce the ring was positioned into place and clamped down the welding
    could start.<br>
    The front and back of the ring,&nbsp; got welded all around for added support to the
    car.&nbsp; <br>
    Holes were then taped and threaded for the woofer box mounting. <br>
