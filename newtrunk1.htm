    you get to see that 99.9% of the cars have stretch carpeting because it is<br>
    easy to install. After a while, most of the trunks look the same, with the same fuzz. On
    one occasion,<br>
    I saw a new Rolls Royce trunk, and this changed my thought pattern. <br>
    It look finished, with all edges neatly stitched. A clean look abounded. <br>
    That is when the decision was made to go with hard-backed carpet. Keep<br>
    in mind this is VERY VERY VERY hard to work with. If you can completely<br>
    do a trunk in stretch carpet in 6 hours, this will take three to four times<br>
    longer and a lot of muscle. When you see the car in person, you tell me if the<br>
    effort was worth the time. Most everyone comments on the clean look.</font></h5>

    <strong>T</strong>he spare-tire well gets carpeted.<br>
    Next a board was trimmed to size and a cutout for the spare tire was made. <br>
    A metal support ring was then made to hold the spare tire cover board.<br>
    The entire assembly was then carpeted.<br>
    I bought new factory trunk side panels for recovering.<br>
    First thing that needed to be done was to strip the rubber backing off of carpet.<br>
    A major job in itself.<br>
    The rear, seat armrest board was then covered with a tube made to cover edges .<br>
    The side panel was done in two pieces due to certain curves on the panel.<br>
    All edges were taped so the glue would dry with a tight fit.<br>
    Notice finished side panels with their clean look?<br>
    The bottom panel of trunk was then stitched around the entire edge.<br>
    Carpet was cut for the struts and edges turned first and glued.<br>
    Carpet was then wrapped and all edges filled in.<br>
    The same was done for the trunk hinges. <br>
    Rear sill panel for the lights were carpeted for a factory look. </font></h5>
